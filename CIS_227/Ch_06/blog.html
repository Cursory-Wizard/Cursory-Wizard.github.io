      <h5>Honing your requirements documentation, Sept. 26, 2018</h5>
      <div class="workimg"></div>
      <p>For today’s post we’re going to discuss requirements documentation
	  and what I consider to be the best practices for creating one that is 
	  effective, adaptable, and thorough. Project documentation is demanding 
	  work but it’s vital to the success of your software and the advancement
	  of your own skills as a software designer. Setting out to develop a product
	  without a strong guiding principle is the fastest way to produce a muddled
	  design mired in complicated, difficult to maintain code. With these best
	  practices you will have a strong start and look forward to an equally strong finish.
	  Let’s get started, shall we?</p><br>
	  <p><strong>Identify your stakeholders – </strong>
	  No product is designed with ‘no one’ in mind and no project is started because
	  ‘no one’ requested it. I can hear you say: we already know who the stakeholders
	  are, they’re the people sitting in front of us asking for our help! 
	  Unfortunately, that is incorrect. Those are your customers. They are certainly 
	  included in your stakeholders, but they represent only the tiniest portion of your eventual 
	  end-users. However, they are the final decision-makers and their input matters most. 
	  Assist them in identifying the other stakeholders.  Consider asking
	  <a href="https://hbr.org/2014/03/five-questions-to-identify-key-stakeholders"> these five questions</a>
	   to help find them.</p>
	  <p>As you can see from the article, even a small medical practice has innumerable persons
	  upon which they rely, people that may use this product and will have to be included in a
	  requirements documentation to make it a complete success. Using this example, lead your
	  customers through their stakeholders and help them identify each one.</p>
	  <br>
	  <p><strong>Define the scope of the requirements process – </strong>Framework, framework, 
	  framework. Repeat it. Stakeholders will range in accessibility: Your customers may be 
	  easy to interact with, but <i>they</i> may have a proposed customer base that is nebulous and 
	  hard to qualify. The framework of the process needs to identify a reporting mechanism 
	  that ensures rigid documentation. It must include source, reliability, and accountability. 
	  Lastly, it needs to include a termination aspect where both you and the customer resolve 
	  that the requirements from that stakeholder have been identified. A good requirements 
	  process is the difference between ‘The stakeholders tell us’ and the much more inaccurate 
	  ‘We have heard…’. Make your documentation framework integral now and it will be effortless 
	  to modify later (and modify it you will!).</p>
	  <br>
	  <p><strong>Model your requirements – </strong>Defined, detailed interpretations of the requirements are
	  essential in setting both goals and expectations. Your own design team needs a complete 
	  understanding of what the customer is asking for and modeling is the most effective way 
	  to bring the two groups together.
	  <img src="images/req.jpg" id="minipic"/></p>
	  <p>Unified Modeling Language(UML) is your friend, here. Working from a trackable, easy
	  to read, UML table will provide both your customers and design team with a clear description
	  of your requirements. If you want to practice, head over to <a href "https://draw.io">draw.io</a> 
	  and select ‘UML’. You’ll be presented with several templates that fit nearly every situation.
	  Working in a UML document eliminates abstract goals by necessitating a thorough outline of each
	  requirement.</p>
	  <br>
	  <p><strong>Prioritize your requirements – </strong>Not every idea is equal, and time is not
	  infinite. Your customers and stakeholders will have an extensive list at this point. Hopefully,
	  your design team has a clear idea of them, thanks to the UML. Now it is time to prioritize and 
	  set expectations.</p>
	  <p>This is often a painful process because everyone wants to be involved. You may find that each
	  person has a handful of requirements they want to see included and aren’t very much concerned with
	  the rest. Your customer has seen their initial requirements balloon into something they may not 
	  be capable of encompassing and it may have them concerned. Clearly, you need a method of ranking
	  requirements that will keep everyone involved.</p>
	  <p>There are <a href="https://businessanalystlearnings.com/blog/2016/8/18/a-list-of-requirements-prioritization-techniques-you-should-know-about">
	  numerable ways</a> to prioritize a requirements list. My personal suggestion to you is that
	  this decision is one of the reasons you are a project leader. Either make it yourself or in
	  conjunction with a small management team. Don’t stress the process by adding a 
	  <i>decision about how to make decisions</i>. Whether it be MoSCoW, AHP, or bubble sort
	  (my personal favorite for smaller lists), choose one and use it to determine your final
	  requirements list.</p>
	  <br>
	  <p><strong>Finalize and capture lessons learned – </strong>That’s it, you’re done! Time
	  to sign off on the requirements document, get it off your desktop, and move on to the
	  process of building the product. Right? <i>Right?</i></p>
	  <p>I mean…you could. But in doing so you will be missing the most important lesson of
	  documentation and hobbling yourself when that same requirements document comes around again
	  (you know it will).</p>
	  <p><i>How</i> complete is this document? <i>What</i> were the accomplishments? <i>Where</i> do you feel the
	  process could have been improved? <i>Why</i> were these missteps made?</p>
	  <p>Ask these questions and <i>document the answers.</i> The requirements document is a living 
	  document and will change with each iteration of the product. Keeping a record of your process 
	  and your findings is immeasurably important to your continued success and the support of your 
	  customers.</i></p>
	  <br>
	  <p>A requirements document is a difficult beast to master but it’s often the single thing
	  standing between your team and success with a product. There are many, many other lessons
	  and other best practices; these five only represent mine. Keeping expanding your methods
	  and continue to refine your process. Every small win you have is a contributor to great
	  achievement in the end.</p>
